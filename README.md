# AutoFixUp

A simple extension for your browser that automatically changes the copied URL to `fixupx` or `fxtwitter` instead. The extension works by detecting whether you are on either `x.com` or `twitter.com` page and listening to the changes in your clipboard to quickly change the URL and add the changed URL to the clipboard.

## Installation

Load the `AutoFixUp.crx` file to your browser and install it.

## Usage

Click the `Copy Link` option in the `x.com` share menu and the correctly formatted URL will be in your clipboard ready to be pasted.
